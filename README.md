# SplitwiseAI

SplitwiseAI is an AI-driven expense tracking system that enhances traditional expense-tracking applications by incorporating features such as voice-based expense entry and AI-driven automatic categorization. It provides users with group-based tracking, global and group-specific category management, and advanced automation capabilities using OpenAI's Whisper and ChatGPT models.

## Features

- **Global and Group-Specific Categories**: Manage predefined global categories and create custom group-specific categories for personalized expense tracking.

- **Group and User Management**: Create groups, manage members, and assign roles with specific permissions.

- **Expense Entry and Tracking**: Add expenses with details like amount, description, and category; split payments among group members; and track balances.

- **Voice-Based Expense Entry**: Utilize OpenAIâ€™s Whisper API to convert voice input into text for hands-free expense entry.

- **AI-Powered Category Inference**: Leverage OpenAI's ChatGPT to automatically categorize expenses based on descriptions, reducing manual effort.
